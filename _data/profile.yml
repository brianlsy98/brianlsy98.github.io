    Hi all! I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science (CS) at the
    <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a>,
    working with Prof. <a href="https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/keshav-pingali/">Keshav Pingali</a>.
    I also worked closely with Prof. <a href="https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/">David Z. Pan</a> and Prof. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274430800">Deog-Kyoon Jeong</a>.
    I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)
    from <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/">Seoul National University</a> with highest honor, in 2023.
    My research interest is in efficient and scalable machine learning, currently focusing on graph and deep reinforcement learning (RL).
