Hi! I am a PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Austin, working with Professor David Z. Pan. I finished my B.S. in August 2023 from Seoul National University (SNU) with the highest honor.

My research focuses on applying Machine Learning (ML) to Integrated Circuit (IC) design. I am particularly interested in leveraging Graph ML and Generative Models to enhance the design automation process. In the domain of IC design, I am specifically interested in Analog, RF, and Mixed-Signal ICs.

Hope we can design circuits by proactively harnessing the power of AI!
