Hi! I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working with Prof. [David Z. Pan](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/).
I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) from [Seoul National University (SNU)](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/) with highest honor, in 2023.

My current research interest lies in Machine Learning on Graphs, targeting the application to Analog and Mixed-Signal Circuits.
* Graph Representation Learning
* Graph Generation
